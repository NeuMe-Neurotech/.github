# NeuMe Neurotech

## Where Hope Meets Neuroscience.

It Started with a Heartbreak.

Four months ago, my mother had a stroke at the age of 52.

In the weeks that followed, we saw what felt like a miracle: she learned to walk again. Her body, through incredible effort, was recovering. But her mind was lost somewhere we couldn't reach. She would look at me, and I could see she didn't know who I was. Her memories, her personality, the very essence of the woman who raised me—was gone.

Her fight became my own. As we navigated the healthcare system, I discovered a devastating truth: cognitive rehabilitation in India is a field left behind. We had world-class options for her body, but almost none for her mind.

I could not accept that. For my mother, and for the millions of other families in India watching a loved one fade away, I knew I had to build a better answer.

That is why NeuMe exists.

## Our Solution: A Dedicated Gym for the Brain

We are building what should have existed for my mother: a dedicated, intensive gym for the brain. NeuMe is a complete ecosystem that combines cutting-edge Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology with engaging, gamified software to create a powerful, closed-loop system that promotes neuroplasticity—the brain's incredible ability to heal and rewire itself.

We don't just give patients drills; we give them a world to play in.

## The Science of How We Heal

Our technology is designed to create a constant, dynamic conversation between a patient's brain and our software.

 The Mind as the Controller <br>
Our EEG-based BCI headset is the core of the experience. It non-invasively reads the brain's electrical signals, allowing a patient's intent—their focus, their desire to move, their recognition of a target—to become the controller. For the first time, they are not just receiving therapy; they are driving their own recovery with their mind.

 An AI That Listens and Adapts <br>
Our platform is powered by a living, domain-specific AI engine that understands the unique language of the brain.

Real-Time Neuro-Translation: Foundational ML/DL models process raw EEG signals in real-time, classifying cognitive states like motor imagery and attention (P300).

Instant-On Calibration: We use Generative AI to create vast synthetic datasets, allowing new users to skip lengthy calibrations and begin therapy immediately, maximizing their precious recovery window.

Nova, Your Compassionate AI Guide: Central to the experience is Nova, our AI coach powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). Nova offers real-time, empathetic verbal guidance, celebrating victories and offering encouragement when it detects frustration, making therapy feel less like a task and more like a supported journey.

## Our Promise: An India-First Revolution in Cognitive Care

We are building a future-proof platform designed specifically for the needs and affordability of the Indian healthcare system.

 Prototype Developed: We have successfully developed and validated our first working prototype.

 Pilot Studies (3 Months): We are initiating trials with our partner hospitals to rigorously validate efficacy and gather crucial, real-world patient data.

 India-First Design: Our solution is built with multi-language support and affordable deployment across both hospital and home settings.

 Future-Proof Platform: We are building in Multimodal Fusion to integrate data from EEG, fNIRS, eye tracking, and more, creating the most comprehensive cognitive profile available.

## Join Our Fight

We are on a mission to make cutting-edge cognitive rehabilitation accessible to every Indian family who is hoping for a miracle.
